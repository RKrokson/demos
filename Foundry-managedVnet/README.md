# Application Landing Zone — AI Foundry (Managed VNet) - preview

> [!WARNING]
> **This deployment is a work in progress.** It's in preview and may not be in a working state at any given time. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, or failed applies. Use it to experiment, not to depend on.

This is an optional application landing zone. It deploys AI Foundry with AI Agent Service and private endpoints in a Microsoft-managed VNet. You do not need to deploy this to use the Networking module on its own.

This module is based on the [PG-validated Terraform sample](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/infrastructure/infrastructure-setup-terraform/18-managed-virtual-network-preview), modified to pull network dependencies from the platform landing zone via `terraform_remote_state`.

"Secure" refers to the use of private endpoints. Local auth (API keys) is disabled on AI Search and Cognitive Services (`disableLocalAuth = true`). All access requires Entra ID authentication.

The template follows the [documented architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/managed-virtual-network?view=foundry) for AI Foundry Standard Setup with a managed network.

## Prerequisites

- All [platform landing zone prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites)
- Platform Landing Zone (`Networking/`) applied first
- Private DNS zones enabled (`add_private_dns00 = true` in Networking)
- Azure region with AI Foundry support and quota

## Quick Start

```sh
cd Foundry-managedVnet
terraform init && terraform apply
```

**Prerequisites:** Networking module must be applied first with `add_private_dns00 = true`.

## Variables

This module deploys AI Foundry in a Microsoft-managed VNet. Customize the resource group name or use defaults.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `resource_group_name_ai01` | `"rg-ai01"` | Resource group name |
| `ai_vnet_address_space` | `["172.20.48.0/20"]` | VNet address range |
| `ai_foundry_subnet_address` | `["172.20.48.0/26"]` | Foundry workload subnet |
| `connect_to_vhub` | `true` | Connect to platform hub |
| `enable_dns_link` | `false` | Link to platform DNS resolver |

For GPT deployment names, SKUs, and other service config, see `variables.tf`.

## Outputs

| Output | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `resource_group_id` | Resource group ID |
| `ai_foundry_id` | AI Foundry account ID |
| `ai_foundry_project_id` | AI Foundry project ID |
| `storage_account_id` | Storage account ID |
| `cosmosdb_account_id` | Cosmos DB account ID |
| `ai_search_id` | AI Search service ID |

## Cleanup

⚠️ **Soft-delete gotcha:** After `terraform destroy`, Foundry enters soft-delete state with a `serviceassociationlink` to the AI subnet. You must purge it before destroying Networking, or the subnet delete will fail. Wait ~10 minutes after purge completes.

## Troubleshooting

**Quota issues during model deployment?**

- "SKU 'S0' from kind 'OpenAI' ... blocked QuotaId/Feature"
  → Verify your region supports Foundry and check quota in Management Center. See [region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).

- "InsufficientQuota: Tokens Per Minute ... 30 and the quota limit is 30"
  → Your quota is maxed out. Delete another model deployment or reduce its capacity.
