# Teardown Summary — 2026-07-16
**Author:** Donut (Infra Dev)
**Requested by:** Ryan Krokson
**Purpose:** Full environment teardown for clean Fabric testing slate

---

## Environment State Before Teardown

| Module | Resources in State | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Foundry-byoVnet | 2 (terraform_remote_state + random_string) | Destroyed |
| Foundry-managedVnet | 0 | Skipped |
| Fabric-private | No state file | Skipped |
| ContainerApps-byoVnet | 0 | Skipped |
| Networking | 944 | Destroyed |

## Operations Performed

1. **Foundry-byoVnet destroy** — 1 resource removed (random_string). No Azure resources were deployed. Instant.
2. **Soft-delete check** — `az cognitiveservices account list-deleted` returned empty. No purge needed.
3. **Networking destroy** — 579 resources destroyed in 44.3 minutes total (30 min modtm refresh + 14 min Azure destroy).

## Timing Breakdown (Networking)

- State refresh phase: ~30 min (181 modtm_module_source outbound GitHub calls)
- Azure resource deletion: ~14 min
- vHub destruction: 10m45s (normal)
- vWAN destruction: 12s
- Resource group deletion: 11s
- Total: 44.3 minutes

## Post-Teardown Azure State

**All project resource groups deleted.** Remaining RGs are pre-existing and NOT from this project:

| RG Name | Location | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Default-ActivityLogAlerts | eastus | Azure platform |
| NetworkWatcherRG | eastus | Azure platform |
| rg-shared00-krok | centralus | Pre-existing (not our naming pattern) |
| rg-arc00-krok | centralus | Pre-existing (not our naming pattern) |
| McapsGovernance | westus2 | Azure governance |

**Environment is clean.** Ready for Fabric testing.

## Key Findings

- No SAL/legionservicelink cleanup needed — Foundry-byoVnet was never deployed to Azure this cycle
- modtm state refresh is the dominant time cost (~30 min), not the Azure destroy (~14 min)
- vHub InternalServerError did NOT occur this cycle
- Subscription: b6b5dea5-81d3-4e4a-85f3-b05266fc6f89 (ME-rykrokso-01)

# Decision: Enable Bastion IP-Connect and Native Client by Default

**Author:** Donut (Infra Dev)
**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Status:** Implemented

## Context

Azure Bastion Standard SKU supports two opt-in features that are useful for lab environments:
- ip_connect_enabled — connect to VMs by private IP address (not just resource ID). Enables cross-VNet Bastion scenarios.
- 	unneling_enabled — enables native client support via z network bastion tunnel, z network bastion rdp, and z network bastion ssh CLI commands.

Both features require Standard SKU (not available on Basic or Developer). Our default SKU is already Standard.

## Decision

Set both ip_connect_enabled = true and 	unneling_enabled = true unconditionally on the zurerm_bastion_host.bastion resource in Networking/modules/region-hub/main.tf. A comment notes the Standard SKU requirement.

No conditional gating on the SKU variable — these are lab environments, and the default is Standard. If someone overrides to Basic or Developer, Terraform will surface a clear Azure API error at apply time.

## Impact

- Backward compatible for existing deployments (Terraform will update the Bastion host in-place on next apply).
- Enables Ryan's cross-VNet and native client testing scenarios per Decision #18 (Bastion + vWAN routing intent validation).
- No new variables or outputs needed.

## Files Changed

- Networking/modules/region-hub/main.tf — added ip_connect_enabled and 	unneling_enabled to bastion resource

# Decision: Disable Purge Protection on Fabric-private Key Vault

**Date:** 2026-07-14  
**Author:** Donut  
**Requested by:** Ryan  
**Module:** Fabric-private/

## Decision

Set purge_protection_enabled = false on zurerm_key_vault.fabric_kv in Fabric-private/fabric.tf.

## Rationale

This is a lab module that Ryan deploys and tears down repeatedly. Purge protection on a Key Vault enforces a minimum 7-day wait (or requires z keyvault purge) between destroy and re-deploy of the same-named resource. That friction has no benefit in a non-production lab environment.

Soft delete is retained (soft_delete_retention_days = 7) as it is an Azure-enforced minimum and provides a recovery window for accidental deletion during a session.

## Trade-offs

- **Accepted risk:** Deleted secrets are recoverable for 7 days via soft-delete but can be immediately purged by any authorized operator. Acceptable for a lab with no production data.
- **Naming collision:** The KV name includes a andom_string suffix, so collisions across destroy/redeploy cycles are unlikely but not possible. README updated to note z keyvault purge as a targeted fix if a collision occurs.

## Alternatives Considered

- Keep purge protection, document z keyvault purge as mandatory step — rejected as unnecessary friction for a lab lifecycle.
- Import soft-deleted KV on redeploy — rejected as operationally complex for no benefit.

# Decision: Fabric Admin Tenant-Settings API Contract

**Author:** Donut (Infrastructure Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-07-15  
**Scope:** Fabric-private/configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1 and any future Fabric admin tooling

## Context

configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1 was returning rrorCode: "UnknownError" on every API call. Investigation against the Microsoft Learn Fabric Admin REST API confirmed two wrong assumptions baked in from initial authorship. This decision records the corrected contract so future infra work doesn't repeat the same mistakes.

## Corrected API Contract

### Read — LIST endpoint (only option)

`
GET https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/admin/tenantsettings
`

- Returns an object with a 	enantSettings array; each element has settingName, nabled, and related fields.
- **No per-setting GET exists.** Calls to GET .../tenantsettings/{settingName} return an error (UnknownError / 404). The script was doing this per-setting GET in a loop — that was the read bug.
- **Pattern:** Call LIST once, cache into a hashtable keyed by settingName, look up each desired setting in the cache. This is also more efficient (one API call instead of N).

### Write — POST /update (not PATCH)

`
POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/admin/tenantsettings/{settingName}/update
Body: { "enabled": true }
`

- The script was issuing PATCH .../tenantsettings/{settingName} (no /update suffix). That verb+path combination does not exist and silently returns UnknownError.
- Body shape is preserved — { "enabled": <bool> } is correct; only the verb and URL suffix changed.

### Required permissions

- Caller must be assigned the **Fabric Administrator** role in the tenant.
- OAuth scope: Tenant.ReadWrite.All (Fabric Admin API audience: https://api.fabric.microsoft.com).
- The existing z account get-access-token --resource https://api.fabric.microsoft.com auth flow is correct — do not change it.

## Setting-Name Validation Pattern

Hardcoded setting names in admin scripts must be validated against the LIST response before attempting any write. If a name is absent from the API's 	enantSettings array, the script must:

1. Emit a warning showing the **expected name** (what the script assumed).
2. Emit a warning showing the **full list of names** the API actually returned.
3. **Skip** rather than attempting a write that will fail silently.

This guards against API-side renames without requiring manual investigation to diagnose failures.

## Error Message Standard

Every catch block that wraps a Fabric Admin API call must surface all three of:

- HTTP status code: $_.Exception.Response.StatusCode.value__
- Response body: $_.ErrorDetails.Message
- URL that was called (log the variable, not a templated string)

The old Write-Warning "Failed to enable : " pattern produced opaque System.Net.WebException strings with no actionable signal.

## Files Changed

- Fabric-private/configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1 — all four issues fixed; auth flow unchanged; setting list unchanged; script invocation unchanged.

## Do Not

- Do not add a per-setting GET before or after the LIST call — it will fail.
- Do not use PATCH against /v1/admin/tenantsettings/{name} — use POST to .../update.
- Do not change the token acquisition (z account get-access-token) — it is correct.

# Decision Drop: Fabric Admin Access Model & Prerequisites Restructure

**Author:** Mordecai  
**Date:** 2026-07-15  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Scope:** Fabric-private README — Prerequisites section  

## Problem Statement

Ryan discovered two silent-failure gates that must be met BEFORE any Fabric tenant configuration (script or manual) will work:

1. Azure RBAC roles (Subscription Owner, Contributor, etc.) grant **zero** Fabric admin authority
2. Even with the correct Entra directory role, tenant-settings API returns nothing until Fabric is provisioned on the tenant

These gates were undocumented in the README, leading users to troubleshoot phantom API failures or hang on script execution without clear guidance.

## Decision: Gate-Based Prerequisites Structure

Restructured Fabric-private README Prerequisites section to document the gate order explicitly:

### Gate 1: Entra Directory Role
- User must hold one of: Global Administrator, Power Platform Administrator, or Fabric Administrator (Entra directory role, not Azure RBAC)
- Document this clearly: Azure RBAC is insufficient
- Link to Entra admin center for role assignment
- Allow 5–15 minutes for role propagation

### Gate 2: Fabric Tenant Provisioning
- Tenant must have Fabric provisioned (Free signup, trial, or F-SKU capacity)
- Provide three options with guidance (Free is fastest)
- Verification step: user can navigate to https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/admin-portal

### Gate 3: Enable Tenant Settings
- Four tenant-level settings (existing content preserved)
- Run script or configure manually via portal
- Re-register Microsoft.Fabric provider after toggling inbound network rules

## Rationale

- **Silent failure mode:** Errors returned are empty/null, not explicit about missing gates
- **Two independent prerequisites:** Role assignment and tenant provisioning are unrelated; both must be true
- **User experience:** Clear gate order + verification step (can access admin portal?) prevents troubleshooting dead-ends
- **Future-proof:** Any Fabric infrastructure automation must document this gate order

## Implementation

- Updated Fabric-private README lines ~24–51
- Kept existing four tenant settings; re-framed under Gate 3
- Added links to Entra admin center and Free signup
- Preserved tone (concise, lab-oriented, no marketing)
- No other README sections modified per scope

## Impact

- All future Fabric ALZ documentation and scripts must reference this gate order in prerequisites
- Any troubleshooting guide or FAQ should address the silent-failure modes (empty API response, script hangs)



# Decision: Fabric Admin API — Verified Tenant Setting Name Mappings

**Author:** Donut (Infra Dev)
**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Status:** Resolved — script updated, SKILL.md updated

---

## Context

configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1 was fixed last round to use the correct LIST + POST pattern against the Fabric Admin REST API. However, all four hardcoded settingName values were wrong — none matched the 161 names the API actually returns. The script ran cleanly but did nothing useful (all four skipped with "name not found" warnings).

---

## Research Method

1. Retrieved all 161 settingName values from live API response (via script run by Ryan).
2. Cross-referenced against Microsoft Learn: learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/tenant-settings-index, service-admin-portal-developer, service-admin-portal-microsoft-fabric-tenant-settings, service-admin-portal-advanced-networking, and the Fabric Admin REST API reference (/rest/api/fabric/admin/tenants/list-tenant-settings).

---

## Verified Intent → API Name Mappings

| Intent (README / script) | Wrong name (was) | Correct settingName | Portal path |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Users can create Fabric items" (the Microsoft Fabric admin switch) | UsersCanCreateFabricItems | **FabricGAWorkloads** | Tenant settings → Microsoft Fabric |
| "Configure workspace-level inbound network rules" | WorkspaceLevelPrivateEndpointSettings | **WorkspaceBlockInboundAccess** | Tenant settings → Advanced networking |
| "Service principals can call Fabric public APIs" | ServicePrincipalsCanCallFabricPublicAPIs | **ServicePrincipalAccessGlobalAPIs** | Tenant settings → Developer settings |

---

## Intents With No API Equivalent

| Intent | Status | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| "Microsoft Fabric" (master toggle — was EnableFabric) | ❌ Removed from script | "Microsoft Fabric" is a **section header** in the admin portal, not a distinct API setting. Its only toggle is "Users can create Fabric items" (FabricGAWorkloads). There is no EnableFabric settingName in the Fabric Admin API. The script now has one entry (FabricGAWorkloads) that covers both original intents 1 and 3. |

---

## Key Insight: "Microsoft Fabric" = "Users can create Fabric items"

From learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/fabric-switch:
> "When you enable Microsoft Fabric using the tenant setting, users can create Fabric items."
> "In your tenant, you can enable Microsoft Fabric... navigate to the tenant settings and in *Microsoft Fabric*, expand **Users can create Fabric items**."

The admin portal UI has:
- **Section:** "Microsoft Fabric"
- **Toggle:** "Users can create Fabric items"

These are one single setting. The API settingName is FabricGAWorkloads. The original script had two entries (EnableFabric and UsersCanCreateFabricItems) that both tried to manage the same underlying setting — but both with wrong names.

---

## Files Changed

- Fabric-private/configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1 — corrected all three remaining settings, removed duplicate EnableFabric entry, added comments
- Fabric-private/README.md — updated Gate 3 to use API names alongside portal names; clarified "Microsoft Fabric" is a section header
- .squad/skills/fabric-admin-api/SKILL.md — added verified mappings table, wrong-names table, and corrected canonical example

### 2026-04-28: User correction — Fabric workspace-level private link IS supported (SUPERSEDED)
**By:** Ryan Krokson (via Copilot)
**Status:** SUPERSEDED by 2026-07-16 fix deployment
**Original claim:** "Fabric private links are tenant-scoped only."
**Correction:** During the 2026-04-28 Fabric-private deploy, Donut removed the workspace-level PE concluding this. This is incorrect. Microsoft documents a supported workspace-level private link flow: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-set-up — including a "deny public access" step that secures the workspace. The current deployment was reachable from the public internet because this configuration was missing.
**Resolution:** Workspace-level PE now correctly deployed 2026-07-16 using `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric` + `azurerm_private_endpoint` with deny-public-access policy (see carl-fabric-workspace-pe-fix & donut-fabric-workspace-pe-deployed entries below).

---

### 2026-07-16: Scope directive — Fabric private link is workspace-level ONLY
**By:** Ryan Krokson (via Copilot)
**What:** Tenant-level Fabric private link is explicitly out of scope. The Fabric-private LZ enables and configures workspace-level private link only. Any future design or implementation work must NOT introduce tenant-level PE configuration, tenant admin private link toggles, or `Microsoft.PowerBI/privateLinkServicesForPowerBI` resources.
**Why:** User-confirmed scope decision — reinforces the workspace-level fix design without expanding into tenant-level territory.

# ADR: Fabric Workspace-Level Private Endpoint — Fix Design

**Author:** Carl (Lead/Architect)
**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Status:** Approved & Deployed
**Reverses:** Incorrect decision from 2026-04-28 ("Fabric private links are tenant-scoped only")
**Corrected by:** Ryan Krokson via `copilot-directive-fabric-workspace-pe-correction.md`

## 1. Doc-Grounded Summary: Workspace-Level Private Link Model

Microsoft Fabric supports private links at **two scopes**: tenant-level and workspace-level. The workspace-level flow allows per-workspace network isolation without affecting the entire tenant.

### How it works (from docs)

**Source:** [Set up and use workspace-level private links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-set-up)

1. **Tenant prerequisite:** A Fabric administrator must enable the tenant setting **"Configure workspace-level inbound network rules"** (Step 0 in the docs — listed under Prerequisites). Without this, the feature is unavailable. This is a tenant admin portal toggle, not an ARM resource.

2. **Resource provider registration:** The `Microsoft.Fabric` resource provider must be re-registered in the Azure subscription that will host the private link service and private endpoint. This is a one-time step per subscription.

3. **Private Link Service (ARM resource):** Deploy an ARM resource of type `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric` (API version `2024-06-01`). This is a **global** resource (location: `global`) that binds a tenant ID + workspace ID pair. It acts as the "anchor" that the private endpoint targets.
   - ARM template from docs:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric",
       "apiVersion": "2024-06-01",
       "name": "<resource-name>",
       "location": "global",
       "properties": {
         "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
         "workspaceId": "<workspace-id>"
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Private Endpoint:** Create a standard Azure private endpoint targeting the above resource. Key parameters:
   - **Resource type:** `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric`
   - **Target sub-resource (group_id):** `workspace`
   - **DNS zone:** `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com`
   - The docs note that **at least 10 IP addresses** should be reserved per workspace PE (currently 5 IPs are allocated per PE).

5. **Deny public access (optional but required for our use case):** Set the workspace communication policy via the Fabric data-plane REST API:
   ```
   PUT https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/networking/communicationPolicy
   Body: {"inbound":{"publicAccessRules":{"defaultAction":"Deny"}}}
   ```
   This takes up to **30 minutes** to take effect per Microsoft docs.

**Source:** [Private links for Fabric tenants (overview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-private-links-overview) — provides context on tenant-level vs workspace-level scoping and limitations.

### Critical distinction: This is NOT the same as tenant-level private link

Tenant-level private link uses `Microsoft.PowerBI/privateLinkServicesForPowerBI` and affects **all** workspaces. Workspace-level uses `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric` and targets a **single workspace**. These are completely different ARM resource types. Donut's original error was conflating these two.

## 2. Terraform Implementation Plan

### Provider strategy

| Component | Provider | Resource type | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private Link Service (anchor) | **azapi** | `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric@2024-06-01` | No `azurerm` resource exists for this type. `azapi` is the only declarative option. |
| Private Endpoint | **azurerm** | `azurerm_private_endpoint` | Standard PE pattern, consistent with `pe_fabric_kv` already in `fabric.tf`. `group_id` = `workspace`. |
| DNS zone group on PE | **azurerm** (inline) | `private_dns_zone_group` block on the PE | Links to Networking's `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com` zone. |
| Deny public access | **terraform_data + local-exec** | Fabric REST API | Already implemented in `workspace-policy.tf`. No changes needed — just needs the PE to exist first. |

### Where the PE lands

The private endpoint goes into the **existing `pe_subnet`** in the Fabric spoke VNet (`azurerm_subnet.pe_subnet`). This is the same subnet hosting the KV PE. The /24 subnet (256 IPs) has plenty of room for the 5 IPs the workspace PE allocates.

### DNS zone

Zone: `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com`
- Already created by the **Networking** module (centralized DNS pattern).
- Already exposed as `dns_zone_fabric_id` output.
- Already validated by `check "fabric_dns_zone_present"` in `main.tf`.
- **No new DNS zone needed.** The PE's `private_dns_zone_group` will reference `data.terraform_remote_state.networking.outputs.dns_zone_fabric_id`.

### Dependency chain

```
azurerm_fabric_capacity → fabric_workspace → azapi_resource (PL service) → azurerm_private_endpoint (workspace PE) → terraform_data (deny public access)
```

The existing `workspace-policy.tf` already has `depends_on = [fabric_workspace.workspace]`. Donut must update this to depend on the **workspace PE** instead, ensuring the private path is live before public access is denied.

## 3. Touch List (files Donut will modify or create, in order)

| # | File | Action | What changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `fabric.tf` | **Modify** | Remove the incorrect comment block. Add: (a) `azapi_resource` for `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric@2024-06-01` — global resource, binds tenant_id + workspace_id; (b) `azurerm_private_endpoint` targeting the PL service with `subresource_names = ["workspace"]`, landing in `pe_subnet`, with `private_dns_zone_group` referencing `dns_zone_fabric_id`. |
| 2 | `workspace-policy.tf` | **Modify** | Update `depends_on` from `fabric_workspace.workspace` to the new workspace PE resource. This ensures the private inbound path is live before public deny takes effect. |
| 3 | `variables.tf` | **No change expected** | `restrict_workspace_public_access` already defaults to `true`. No new variables needed. |
| 4 | `outputs.tf` | **Modify** | Add outputs: `workspace_private_link_service_id`, `workspace_private_endpoint_id`, `workspace_private_endpoint_ip`. |
| 5 | `main.tf` | **No change expected** | `check "fabric_dns_zone_present"` already validates the DNS zone. |
| 6 | `README.md` | **Modify** | Document the workspace PE, tenant prerequisite, and the "deny public access" flow. |

## 4. Recommended Approach

Deploy the workspace-level private endpoint as a two-resource addition to `fabric.tf`: an `azapi_resource` for the `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric` anchor (global, ARM-managed) and a standard `azurerm_private_endpoint` with `group_id = "workspace"` landing in the existing PE subnet, DNS-linked to the Networking module's `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com` zone. Then update `workspace-policy.tf`'s `depends_on` to target the PE (not the bare workspace), ensuring the private path is live before public access is denied. This is a surgical, additive fix.

# Decision: Fabric Workspace-Level Private Endpoint — Deployed

**Author:** Donut (Infra Dev)
**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Branch:** squad/fabric-alz-impl
**Status:** Deployed and verified

## What Was Deployed

Workspace-level private endpoint for the Fabric-private ALZ, as designed in the ADR above and approved per scope directives.

### Resources added to `Fabric-private/`

| Resource | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `azapi_resource.fabric_private_link_service` | `fabric-pls-3886` | `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric@2024-06-01`, location: global, binds tenant + workspace |
| `azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace` | `fabric-workspace-pe-3886` | Lands in `pe_subnet`, DNS: `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com`, subresource: `workspace` |

**PE Private IP:** `172.20.80.5`

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `Fabric-private/fabric.tf` | Removed wrong comment block. Added `azapi_resource.fabric_private_link_service` + `azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace`. Added `schema_validation_enabled = false` to azapi resource. |
| `Fabric-private/workspace-policy.tf` | Updated `depends_on` from `fabric_workspace.workspace` → `azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace`. |
| `Fabric-private/outputs.tf` | Added `workspace_private_link_service_id`, `workspace_private_endpoint_id`, `workspace_private_endpoint_ip`. |
| `Fabric-private/README.md` | Added 30-min propagation callout. Updated Outputs table. |

### Terraform plan summary

- **3 added:** `fabric_private_link_service`, `pe_fabric_workspace`, `approve_mpe_storage` (drift)
- **1 changed:** `azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage` (drift)
- **1 destroyed:** `approve_mpe_storage` replacement (drift)
- **No workspace replacement.** `fabric_workspace.workspace` unchanged.

### Apply outcome

Success. Resources created cleanly:
- `azapi_resource.fabric_private_link_service`: created in 24s
- `azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace`: created in 56s

## Verification

- `workspace_private_endpoint_ip = 172.20.80.5`
- DNS zone `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com` linked via `private_dns_zone_group`
- `workspace-policy.tf` `depends_on` updated
- Propagation of `defaultAction: Deny` can take up to 30 min per Microsoft docs

## Key Fix: Wrong Decision Reversed

The 2026-04-28 deployment incorrectly concluded "Fabric private links are tenant-scoped only." This fix corrects the record. `Microsoft.Fabric/privateLinkServicesForFabric` is a real, workspace-scoped ARM resource type.

**azapi quirk documented:** `schema_validation_enabled = false` required because this resource type is not yet in the azapi bundled schema. See `.squad/skills/fabric-workspace-private-link/SKILL.md` for the pattern.

### 2026-04-28T23:53Z: Fabric next-round scope clarifications

**By:** Ryan (via Copilot)

**Context:** Pre-design brief for Carl's next design pass on Fabric-private. Scope confirmed before teardown completes.

**Decisions:**

1. **Lakehouse:** Add a **native Fabric Lakehouse** (OneLake-backed, `fabric_lakehouse` resource) inside the deployed workspace. NOT a shortcut to external ADLS Gen 2.

2. **Network mode conditional:** Three-way enum `network_mode`:
   - `inbound_only` — **default.** Workspace PE + communicationPolicy (deny public). No MPEs.
   - `outbound_only` — MPEs to storage/etc. only. No workspace PE. Workspace remains publicly reachable. **Niche / demo-only** scenario: customer is OK with public Fabric but needs to reach a private Azure resource.
   - `inbound_and_outbound` — both directions.
   - README must document `outbound_only` use case so future-self knows why it exists.

3. **Storage account upgrades for outbound (MPE) path:**
   - Storage account becomes ADLS Gen 2 (`is_hns_enabled = true`).
   - Enable Fabric **Workspace Identity** on the workspace.
   - Assign **Storage Blob Data Contributor** to the workspace identity SP on the storage account.
   - Shortcut creation is **out of scope** — Ryan will set up the shortcut manually. We're just enabling the prerequisites.

**Sequencing:** Carl designs first → Donut implements → Ryan validates. Hold until teardown completes.



# Design: Fabric-private Next Round — Lakehouse, network_mode, Storage Upgrades

**Author:** Carl (Lead / Architect)
**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Status:** Draft — pending Ryan approval
**Module:** `Fabric-private/`
**Branch target:** squad/fabric-alz-impl (new branch from current HEAD)

---

## 1. Native Fabric Lakehouse

### Provider support — confirmed

`fabric_lakehouse` is a first-class resource in `microsoft/fabric` provider (GA since ~1.x). Verified from the [provider docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/fabric/latest/docs/resources/lakehouse).

Required attributes: `display_name`, `workspace_id`.
Optional: `description`, `configuration.enable_schemas`, `definition` (for bootstrapping metadata/shortcuts — not needed here).

### Decision: single hardcoded lakehouse, no parameterization

This is a demo lab. One lakehouse is enough to prove the pattern. Adding `count` or `for_each` over a name list adds variable surface area that nobody will use and makes the `network_mode` gating (§2) more complex for zero benefit.

The existing `workspace_content_mode` variable already reserves `"lakehouse"` as a future value. We activate it now.

### Resource shape

```hcl
# fabric.tf — new block, after fabric_workspace

resource "fabric_lakehouse" "lab_lakehouse" {
  count        = var.workspace_content_mode == "lakehouse" ? 1 : 0
  display_name = "lakehouse-${random_string.unique.result}"
  workspace_id = fabric_workspace.workspace.id
  description  = "Lab Lakehouse — OneLake-backed, deployed by Fabric-private module"
}
```

### File placement

Lives in `fabric.tf` alongside the workspace and capacity — it's a workspace-scoped Fabric item, not a networking or storage concern.

### Variable change

Update `workspace_content_mode` validation to accept `"lakehouse"`:

```hcl
variable "workspace_content_mode" {
  description = "Sample content to deploy in the workspace. 'none' ships an empty workspace. 'lakehouse' deploys a native OneLake-backed Lakehouse."
  type        = string
  default     = "none"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["none", "lakehouse"], var.workspace_content_mode)
    error_message = "Allowed values: 'none', 'lakehouse'."
  }
}
```

### Naming

Pattern: `lakehouse-{4-digit-suffix}`. Matches our `{name}-{suffix}` convention. No region abbreviation — Fabric items are workspace-scoped, not region-scoped ARM resources.

### Dependencies

- `fabric_workspace.workspace` (direct reference via `workspace_id`)
- No dependency on networking, MPEs, or storage. The lakehouse is OneLake-backed (Fabric-native storage), not a shortcut to the lab storage account.
- Shortcut creation is **out of scope** — Ryan does that manually.

### OneLake purge consideration

Per decisions.md L5: when `lakehouse` mode is implemented, the `purge-soft-deleted.ps1` script needs a TODO for OneLake item purge. Donut should add that comment in this round.

---

## 2. Three-Way `network_mode` Conditional

### Variable definition

```hcl
variable "network_mode" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Controls which private connectivity paths are deployed.
      inbound_only        — workspace PE + deny-public-access policy. No MPEs, no storage account, no SQL, no KV. (Default)
      outbound_only       — MPEs + storage + SQL + KV. No workspace PE, no communication policy. Workspace is publicly reachable.
      inbound_and_outbound — both directions. Full private connectivity.
  EOT
  type        = string
  default     = "inbound_only"
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["inbound_only", "outbound_only", "inbound_and_outbound"], var.network_mode)
    error_message = "Allowed values: 'inbound_only', 'outbound_only', 'inbound_and_outbound'."
  }
}
```

### What `restrict_workspace_public_access` becomes

This variable is **replaced** by `network_mode`. Previously it was a standalone bool. Now the communication policy fires when `network_mode` contains "inbound" — i.e., `inbound_only` or `inbound_and_outbound`. No separate toggle needed; the mode implies the policy.

### Locals for gating

Add to `locals.tf`:

```hcl
locals {
  deploy_inbound  = contains(["inbound_only", "inbound_and_outbound"], var.network_mode)
  deploy_outbound = contains(["outbound_only", "inbound_and_outbound"], var.network_mode)
}
```

All conditional resources use `count = local.deploy_inbound ? 1 : 0` or `count = local.deploy_outbound ? 1 : 0`.

### Resource-to-mode mapping (file by file)

| File | Resource | `inbound_only` | `outbound_only` | `inbound_and_outbound` | Gating expression |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fabric.tf** | `azurerm_fabric_capacity` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Always |
| | `data.fabric_capacity.this` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Always |
| | `fabric_workspace.workspace` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Always |
| | `fabric_lakehouse.lab_lakehouse` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `workspace_content_mode` (orthogonal) |
| | `azapi_resource.fabric_private_link_service` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | `local.deploy_inbound` |

| **networking.tf** | VNet, subnet, NSG, vHub connection, DNS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Always (spoke is needed for both — PE subnet hosts workspace PE in inbound, and the spoke is still the platform connectivity path) |
| **fabric.tf** | `azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | `local.deploy_outbound` |
| | `azurerm_mssql_server.lab_sql` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | `local.deploy_outbound` |
| | `azurerm_mssql_database.lab_db` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | `local.deploy_outbound` |
| **main.tf** | RG, random_string, remote_state, checks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Always |

### File refactoring note

The storage account, SQL server, and SQL database currently live in `fabric.tf`. For clarity with the mode gating, Donut should consider moving them to a new `storage.tf` file. Not mandatory — the `count` gating works regardless of file placement — but it makes the "outbound resources" obvious at a glance. Call it out in the PR but don't block on it.

### Networking in `outbound_only` mode

The spoke VNet, subnet, NSG, vHub connection, and DNS config deploy in ALL modes. Rationale:
- In `inbound_only`: the PE subnet hosts the workspace PE.
- In `outbound_only`: the spoke is still needed for platform DNS resolution and future extensibility. The PE subnet exists but hosts no PEs. This is harmless — an empty subnet in a /20 block costs nothing.
- Removing networking conditionally would add complexity for no cost savings and would break the "all ALZs have a spoke" invariant.

### `outbound_only` — when and why

This mode exists for a specific demo scenario: customer is fine with Fabric being publicly reachable (no workspace PE) but needs the workspace to reach Azure data sources (Storage, SQL, KV) over private connectivity via MPEs. This is common in orgs that haven't enabled workspace-level inbound network rules at the tenant level but still want outbound data-plane privacy.

### Outputs gating

All outputs referencing conditional resources must use `try()` or conditional expressions. Example:

```hcl
output "workspace_private_endpoint_ip" {
  description = "Private IP of the workspace PE (null if network_mode excludes inbound)"
  value       = local.deploy_inbound ? azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace[0].private_service_connection[0].private_ip_address : null
}
```

Donut applies this pattern to all conditional outputs.

### README blurb for `outbound_only`

Add to the Variables table and a new section:

> **`outbound_only` mode:** Deploys Managed Private Endpoints (MPEs) from the Fabric workspace to Storage, SQL, and Key Vault, plus the backing resources themselves. The workspace remains publicly reachable — no workspace-level PE or deny-public-access policy is created. Use this when: (a) the Fabric tenant setting "Configure workspace-level inbound network rules" is not enabled, or (b) the customer accepts public Fabric access but requires private data-plane connectivity to Azure resources. This is a valid demo/POC pattern for organizations exploring Fabric's outbound private networking without committing to inbound lockdown.

---

## 3. Storage Upgrades for Outbound (MPE) Path

### 3a. ADLS Gen 2 upgrade

Change `azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage`:

```hcl
account_kind      = "StorageV2"       # unchanged
is_hns_enabled    = true              # NEW — enables ADLS Gen 2 / hierarchical namespace
```

This is a one-line addition. `is_hns_enabled = true` on a `StorageV2` account enables the Data Lake Storage Gen 2 APIs (hierarchical namespace). The MPE `target_subresource_type` stays `"blob"` — ADLS Gen 2 blob endpoint works identically for PE/MPE purposes. The `"dfs"` subresource is not needed for the MPE because Fabric accesses ADLS Gen 2 via the blob endpoint internally.

**Breaking change note:** `is_hns_enabled` is a ForceNew attribute in azurerm. Since the lab was just torn down and there's no deployed state, this is a clean-slate change. No import or state surgery needed.

### 3b. Workspace Identity — provider support confirmed (no REST fallback needed)

**Finding:** The `microsoft/fabric` provider's `fabric_workspace` resource has **native support** for workspace identity via an `identity` block:

```hcl
resource "fabric_workspace" "workspace" {
  display_name = "fabric-workspace-${random_string.unique.result}"
  capacity_id  = data.fabric_capacity.this.id
  description  = "Fabric workspace for Private lab deployment"

  identity = {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}
```

Source: [fabric_workspace resource docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/fabric/latest/docs/resources/workspace)

The `identity` block exposes read-only attributes:
- `identity.application_id` (String) — the Entra application ID
- `identity.service_principal_id` (String) — the service principal object ID

This is a declarative, state-tracked resource attribute. No `terraform_data` + REST API workaround. No `azapi_resource_action`. The provider handles the `POST /v1/workspaces/{id}/provisionIdentity` call internally.

**Gating:** The identity block should only be present when `local.deploy_outbound` is true (identity is needed for the RBAC assignment to storage). However, `identity` is an optional nested block on the workspace — you can't conditionally include a block via `count`. Two options:

- **Option A (recommended):** Always provision the identity regardless of mode. It's free, causes no side effects, and avoids dynamic block complexity. The RBAC assignment is still gated by `local.deploy_outbound`.
- **Option B:** Use `dynamic "identity"` block gated on `local.deploy_outbound`. More precise but adds complexity for no real benefit in a lab.

**Decision: Option A.** Always provision identity. It's idempotent, costs nothing, and simplifies the workspace resource to a single block with no dynamic magic.

### 3c. RBAC: Storage Blob Data Contributor

```hcl
# storage.tf (or fabric.tf — wherever storage lives)

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "workspace_identity_storage" {
  count                = local.deploy_outbound ? 1 : 0
  scope                = azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage[0].id
  role_definition_name = "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
  principal_id         = fabric_workspace.workspace.identity.service_principal_id
  principal_type       = "ServicePrincipal"
}
```

### 3d. Timing: Entra ID propagation delay

Workspace identity provisioning creates a service principal in Entra ID. There's a well-known propagation delay (typically 30-60 seconds, sometimes longer) before the SP is visible to Azure RBAC. If `azurerm_role_assignment` fires immediately after identity creation, it can fail with "principal not found."

**Strategy: `time_sleep` + explicit dependency chain.**

```hcl
resource "time_sleep" "wait_for_identity_propagation" {
  count           = local.deploy_outbound ? 1 : 0
  create_duration = "60s"
  depends_on      = [fabric_workspace.workspace]

  triggers = {
    sp_id = fabric_workspace.workspace.identity.service_principal_id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "workspace_identity_storage" {
  count                = local.deploy_outbound ? 1 : 0
  scope                = azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage[0].id
  role_definition_name = "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
  principal_id         = fabric_workspace.workspace.identity.service_principal_id
  principal_type       = "ServicePrincipal"

  depends_on = [time_sleep.wait_for_identity_propagation]
}
```

**Why `time_sleep` over retry loops:**
- Terraform has no native retry mechanism for `azurerm_role_assignment`.
- A `local-exec` retry loop is brittle and non-declarative.
- `time_sleep` is honest about what's happening — we're waiting for eventual consistency. 60 seconds covers the observed propagation window with margin.
- `principal_type = "ServicePrincipal"` is critical — without it, ARM does a Graph lookup that fails during the propagation window. With it, ARM skips the lookup and trusts the caller.

**Provider dependency:** `time_sleep` requires the `hashicorp/time` provider. Add to `config.tf`:

```hcl
time = {
  source  = "hashicorp/time"
  version = "~> 0.12"
}
```

### 3e. Open risk: identity already exists

If a workspace already has an identity provisioned (e.g., from a prior apply or manual portal action), adding the `identity` block should be idempotent — the provider should detect the existing identity and import it into state. Verify during first apply. If the provider errors on "identity already exists," the workaround is `terraform import` or a targeted state operation. Low risk — this is a clean-slate lab.

---

## 4. Open Questions for Ryan

1. **`workspace_content_mode` default:** Should the default change from `"none"` to `"lakehouse"` for the next round, or keep `"none"` and let operators opt in via tfvars? I lean toward keeping `"none"` — lakehouse is additive and some demos don't need it.

2. **Minimum provider version bump:** The `identity` block on `fabric_workspace` and the PR "Allow workspace identity without capacity_id" landed around v1.9.x. Our current constraint is `~> 1.0`. Should we pin to `~> 1.9` to guarantee identity support, or keep `~> 1.0` and let `terraform init` pull latest? I recommend `~> 1.9` — identity is load-bearing for the RBAC assignment.

3. **`outbound_only` as default for any scenario?** Current default is `inbound_only`. If you want a different default for the next demo round, flag it. I'll keep `inbound_only` unless told otherwise.

---

## 5. Summary of Changes by File

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `variables.tf` | Add `network_mode` (replace `restrict_workspace_public_access`). Update `workspace_content_mode` validation. |
| `locals.tf` | Add `deploy_inbound`, `deploy_outbound` locals. |
| `config.tf` | Add `hashicorp/time` provider. Bump `fabric` provider constraint to `~> 1.9`. |
| `fabric.tf` | Add `fabric_lakehouse` (gated on `workspace_content_mode`). Add `identity` block to `fabric_workspace`. Gate workspace PE resources on `deploy_inbound`. Gate storage/SQL/KV on `deploy_outbound`. Add `is_hns_enabled = true` to storage. |
| `mpe.tf` | Gate all MPE resources + approvals + checks on `deploy_outbound`. |
| `workspace-policy.tf` | Replace `restrict_workspace_public_access` gating with `deploy_inbound`. |
| `networking.tf` | No changes — always deploys. |
| `main.tf` | No structural changes. |
| `outputs.tf` | Conditional outputs for all mode-gated resources. |
| `storage.tf` (new, optional) | Move storage + SQL + role assignment here for clarity. |
| `README.md` | Document `network_mode`, `outbound_only` use case, lakehouse option, workspace identity. |

---

## 6. Dependency Chain (apply order)

```
RG + random_string
  → Fabric capacity
    → Fabric workspace (with identity block)
      → [if lakehouse] fabric_lakehouse
      → [if inbound] PL service → workspace PE → communication policy
      → [if outbound] time_sleep (60s for identity propagation)
        → Storage account (ADLS Gen 2) + SQL + KV
          → Role assignment (Storage Blob Data Contributor)
          → MPEs → PE connection lookups → approvals → checks
          → KV PE
```

No circular dependencies. The `time_sleep` only blocks the role assignment, not the storage account creation itself.

---

## 7. What's NOT in Scope

- **Shortcut creation** — manual (Ryan's ask)
- **Tenant-level private link** — still deferred
- **OneLake firewall / data exfiltration controls** — future
- **`enable_schemas` on lakehouse** — not needed for basic demo; can add later as a variable if requested
- **DFS subresource MPE** — Fabric uses blob endpoint internally; dfs MPE is unnecessary for this pattern




# Donut Implementation Note — Fabric-private Next Round (2026-07-25)

**Author:** Donut (Infra Dev)
**Relates to:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/carl-fabric-next-round-design.md`
**Branch:** squad/fabric-alz-impl
**Commit:** 82274ff

---

## Decisions Made During Implementation

### 1. check block data sources with count=0 resources

**Decision:** Used `one(resource[*].attribute)` + `try(null.attribute, fallback)` in locals to null-safely access count=0 resources. In check blocks, used null-safe locals to construct `resource_id`, with `!local.deploy_outbound || <condition>` short-circuit in assertions.

**Why:** `check {}` blocks don't support `count`. Can't use `[0]` indexing in unconditionally-evaluated expressions without risking a plan-time error. The `one(splat)` + `try()` pattern is the idiomatic Terraform solution. Check block data sources that receive a placeholder resource_id fail gracefully (warning only), and the assertion short-circuit ensures the check always passes in non-applicable modes.

**Pattern:**
```hcl
# In locals — safe null access
_lab_storage_id = one(azurerm_storage_account.lab_storage[*].id)

# In check block
resource_id = local._lab_storage_id != null ? (
  "${local._lab_storage_id}/privateEndpointConnections/${coalesce(local.storage_pe_conn_name, "placeholder")}"
) : "placeholder-not-deployed"

# In assertion — short-circuit
condition = !local.deploy_outbound || data.azapi_resource.mpe_storage_conn.output...status == "Approved"
```

### 2. [0] indexing inside count-gated resources

**Decision:** Used `[0]` indexing freely inside resource bodies where both the referencing and referenced resources share the same `count = local.deploy_outbound ? 1 : 0` condition.

**Why:** Terraform only evaluates resource body expressions when count > 0 and the resource is being instantiated. When both resources have count=0, the body of the dependent resource is never evaluated, so the `[0]` index is safe. This is standard Terraform practice for co-conditioned resources.

### 3. pre-existing staged changes included in commit

`main.tf` and `configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1` had pre-existing staged changes from a prior session:
- `main.tf`: renamed comment, removed stale `check "key_vault_present"` (the Fabric LZ no longer references a Networking-layer KV)
- `configure-fabric-tenant-settings.ps1`: corrected API setting names (EnableFabric → FabricGAWorkloads, etc.), added API contract documentation

These were included in the same commit since they're directly related to the module's evolution and were already staged.

### 4. purge-soft-deleted.ps1 does not exist

Carl's design referenced adding a TODO comment to `purge-soft-deleted.ps1`. That script does not exist in the module. The TODO was placed as a comment in `fabric.tf` near the lakehouse resource instead.

### 5. workspace_policy depends_on uses list reference (no [0])

`depends_on = [azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace]` references all instances of the resource (the list), not a single instance. When count=0, the depends_on is an empty dependency list — effectively a no-op. When count=1, it correctly depends on the single instance. This is valid Terraform syntax and doesn't require `[0]`.

# Donut Deploy Findings — 2026-04-29

**From:** Donut (Infra Dev)  
**Branch:** squad/fabric-alz-impl  
**Deploy:** Networking LZ + Fabric-private ALZ (network_mode=inbound_and_outbound, workspace_content_mode=lakehouse)  
**Status:** Two code bugs found and fixed. Full deploy succeeded.

---

## Finding 1: Fabric Lakehouse display_name rejects hyphens (CODE FIXED)

**Severity:** Medium — causes apply failure on first deploy  
**File:** `Fabric-private/fabric.tf`

**What happened:** `fabric_lakehouse` resource failed with `InvalidInput` — "DisplayName is Invalid for ArtifactType. DisplayName: `lakehouse-2679`".

**Root cause:** Fabric item display_name only allows letters, numbers, and underscores. Hyphens are valid for workspace names (and Azure resource names) but are rejected by Fabric for items (lakehouses, datasets, etc.).

**Fix applied (this session):** Changed display_name from `"lakehouse-${random_string.unique.result}"` → `"Lakehouse_${random_string.unique.result}"`.

**Action for team:** None needed — fix is committed. Note for any future Fabric item display_name values: letters/numbers/underscores only.

---

## Finding 2: workspace_communication_policy race condition (CODE FIXED)

**Severity:** High — causes silent/partial deploy requiring manual recovery  
**File:** `Fabric-private/workspace-policy.tf`

**What happened:** After workspace PE was connected and Approved, all subsequent `terraform apply` calls for Fabric items (lakehouse, MPEs) failed with `RequestDeniedByInboundPolicy`, even when communicationPolicy was manually set to "Allow" via REST.

**Root cause:** Two independent issues compounding:

1. **Code:** `workspace_communication_policy` depended only on `azurerm_private_endpoint.pe_fabric_workspace`. Lakehouse + MPEs depended only on `fabric_workspace`. Terraform scheduled them all in parallel — if the workspace PE completed before the Fabric items, Terraform fired deny-public early, blocking the still-running item creation calls.

2. **Platform behavior:** Once a workspace PE is Connected/Approved, the Fabric platform auto-enforces deny-public for workspace management APIs regardless of the communicationPolicy setting. Manually setting Allow via REST reverts to Deny within ~5 seconds — this is by-design, not a bug. There is no way to create Fabric workspace items from public internet once the workspace PE is connected.

**Fix applied (this session):** Added `fabric_lakehouse.lab_lakehouse`, `mpe_storage`, `mpe_sql`, and `mpe_keyvault` to `depends_on` of `terraform_data.workspace_communication_policy`. Deny-public now fires only after all Fabric items are successfully created.

**Action for team:**
- Fix is committed — no further code change needed.
- **Important operational note:** The deny-public auto-enforcement after workspace PE connection is a permanent platform behavior. All future Fabric item creation (lakehouses, datasets, MPEs) must complete BEFORE the workspace PE is connected and approved, or must go through the workspace private endpoint. Keep the `depends_on` ordering correct if adding new Fabric item types.

---

## Finding 3: Provider gap — terraform import not supported for Fabric resources

**Severity:** Low — operational friction only, no code change needed  
**Resources affected:** `fabric_workspace_managed_private_endpoint`, `fabric_lakehouse`

**What happened:** When Fabric resources were created outside Terraform state (due to partial apply + failure), `terraform import` returned "Resource Import Not Implemented" for the MPE. For the lakehouse, import is theoretically possible but blocked in practice by the deny-public enforcement (import read fails with `RequestDeniedByInboundPolicy` after ~5s revert window).

**Recovery procedure (documented in history.md):**
1. Delete orphaned items via REST
2. Taint communication_policy in Terraform state
3. Targeted destroy of workspace PE + PLS + communication_policy
4. Re-apply (fixed ordering ensures items create before deny-public fires)

**Action for team:** No code change. Be aware that if Fabric resources land outside state (interrupted apply, provider crash), the only recovery path is REST deletion + re-create. Consider adding a warning comment near the MPE resources in `mpe.tf`.

---

## Validation Results (post-deploy)

All checks passed:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Workspace PE provisioning state | Succeeded |

# Finding: SSMS Requires z{xy} Private-Link Connection String Format

**Status:** Finding captured — no IaC policy bug  
**Date:** 2026-07-18  
**Branch:** squad/fabric-alz-impl  
**Author:** Donut (Infrastructure Dev)

## Symptom

SSMS returns `Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Fabric.FabricApiException: Request is denied due to inbound communication policy` when trying to connect to the Lakehouse SQL endpoint from the spoke VM via Bastion. The SQL endpoint DNS resolves to a private IP (workspace PE is working). Stack trace is in `FabricWorkspaceApi.GetAsync` / `GetFabricWorkspaceForConnectionAsync`.

## Investigation

**Confirmed live:**
- `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/networking/communicationPolicy` → `{"inbound":{"publicAccessRules":{"defaultAction":"Deny"}}}` — policy body correct, matches docs exactly.
- `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}` (from public internet) → `RequestDeniedByInboundPolicy` — policy IS active.
- Private DNS zone `privatelink.fabric.microsoft.com` has A records for: `.z96.w.api`, `.z96.blob`, `.z96.c`, `.z96.dfs`, `.z96.onelake` — all pointing to 172.20.80.5. No `.datawarehouse` record (this is by design — see below).
- From public internet, `{workspaceid-no-dashes}.z96.w.api.fabric.microsoft.com` resolves to `20.150.160.125` (public IP). From the VM (using private DNS zone), it resolves to `172.20.80.5`.

## Root Cause

**Not an IaC bug. Policy body is correct. Workspace PE is correctly provisioned.**

SSMS's Fabric-aware connection feature (`FabricWorkspaceApi.GetAsync`) calls the Fabric control-plane API before making the SQL (TDS) connection. When SSMS is given the **regular** SQL endpoint connection string (without z{xy} prefix), it has no private-link context and calls `api.fabric.microsoft.com` (the generic public endpoint) for workspace metadata. This traffic:
1. Leaves the VM via Azure Firewall to the public internet
2. Hits the Fabric API with a public-internet source IP
3. Gets blocked by `defaultAction: Deny` → `RequestDeniedByInboundPolicy`

**The z{xy} fix:** When SSMS receives the workspace-level private-link format of the SQL endpoint connection string (with `.z96.` inserted), it knows it is a private-link connection. It then routes its workspace metadata call through the workspace-specific control-plane FQDN (`{workspaceid-no-dashes}.z96.w.api.fabric.microsoft.com`) instead of `api.fabric.microsoft.com`. That FQDN resolves to the PE private IP (172.20.80.5) via the private DNS zone, and the metadata call succeeds through the PE path.

## The .datawarehouse DNS Gap (by Design)

The docs explicitly note: "The warehouse/SQL endpoint FQDN is not available as part of the DNS configurations for the private endpoint." The `.z96.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com` TDS hostname doesn't have a DNS A record in the private zone — Fabric's public routing recognizes the `z96` prefix and transparently routes TDS traffic to the workspace PE. This is expected behavior, not a misconfiguration.

## Connection Strings (this deployment)

| Format | Value |
|---|---|
| Regular (public) | `akcciftlvaeedneno4jf5yqct4-vkyspfwhsm6u3cqxpuabqlbnzy.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com` |
| Private link (use in SSMS) | `akcciftlvaeedneno4jf5yqct4-vkyspfwhsm6u3cqxpuabqlbnzy.z96.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com` |

z{xy} = `z96` (first two characters of workspace GUID `9627b1aa...` without dashes).

## Fixes Applied

1. **outputs.tf** — Added `lakehouse_sql_connection_string` (public) and `lakehouse_sql_connection_string_private_link` (z{xy} format) outputs so the correct SSMS connection string is always discoverable via `terraform output`.
2. **README.md** — Added "Connecting via SSMS (inbound modes)" section documenting the z{xy} requirement and how to get the private link connection string.

## IaC Formula

```hcl
replace(
  fabric_lakehouse.lab_lakehouse[0].properties.sql_endpoint_properties.connection_string,
  ".datawarehouse.",
  ".z${substr(replace(fabric_workspace.workspace.id, "-", ""), 0, 2)}.datawarehouse."
)
```

## Action for Ryan

1. Run `terraform output lakehouse_sql_connection_string_private_link` from `Fabric-private/`  
2. Use that connection string as the **server name** in SSMS (auth: Entra, port 1433)  
3. Connect from the VM via Bastion — should resolve to PE and succeed

## Rule

For any Fabric workspace with deny-public inbound policy: always use the workspace-level private link format (`z{xy}`) for all SQL endpoint / warehouse connection strings in client tools. The regular connection string will always fail from private networks if the client tool makes a Fabric control-plane API call before the SQL connection.
