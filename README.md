# Azure Network Platform — Landing Zones with Terraform

Terraform for deploying an Azure networking landing zone and optional application landing zones. This repo is for POCs and testing, not production.

## Landing Zone Model

This repo follows a two-tier landing zone pattern:

![Landing Zone Model](docs/landing-zone-model.svg)

**Platform Landing Zone**— Shared networking foundation that all workloads depend on.

| Folder        | Layer    | Description                                                             | Docs                             |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Networking/` | Platform | Azure Virtual WAN, hubs, spoke VNets, optional Firewall and Private DNS | [README](./Networking/README.md) |

**Application Landing Zones** — Optional workloads that plug into the platform. Deploy one or both Foundry modules. Each creates its own spoke VNet with a dedicated address range, so there are no CIDR conflicts. Running both at the same time has not been fully tested.

| Folder                 | Layer       | Description                                                   | Docs                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Foundry-byoVnet/`     | Application | AI Foundry with private endpoints in a BYO VNet               | [README](./Foundry-byoVnet/README.md)     |
| `Foundry-managedVnet/` | Application | AI Foundry with private endpoints in a Microsoft-managed VNet | [README](./Foundry-managedVnet/README.md) |

Future modules will follow the same application landing zone pattern. See the [Adding a New Application Landing Zone](./docs/adding-application-landing-zone.md) guide.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Terraform >= 1.8.3
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable set (see `setSubscription.ps1`)
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and cd into it.

2. Set your subscription:
   ```powershell
   .\setSubscription.ps1
   ```

3. Deploy the **platform landing zone**:
   ```sh
   cd Networking
   terraform init && terraform apply
   ```

4. (Optional) Deploy an **application landing zone**. Each Foundry module is independent:
   ```sh
   cd ../Foundry-byoVnet   # or ../Foundry-managedVnet
   terraform init && terraform apply
   ```
   **Note:** Both Foundry modules need `add_private_dns00 = true` in Networking's tfvars to enable private DNS resolution.

See each module's README for details.

## Destroy Order

⚠️ **Destroy application landing zones first, then the platform.**

1. Destroy a Foundry module:
   ```sh
   cd Foundry-byoVnet   # or Foundry-managedVnet
   terraform destroy
   ```

2. **Purge the soft-deleted AI Foundry resource.** The subnet service association link blocks Networking deletion until this is done. Wait ~10 minutes after purge completes.
   - [Purge a deleted resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-cli#purge-a-deleted-resource)

3. Destroy the platform:
   ```sh
   cd ../Networking
   terraform destroy
   ```

See each module's README for details.

## Cost Estimates

This is for demos and labs. Deploy and delete as needed. Don't leave resources running long-term. You can power off VMs and Azure Firewall to save costs when not in use. Use the [Azure Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for your own estimate.

Rough estimate using Central US, single region:

| Resource                     | Daily (24h) | Monthly (730h) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Azure vWAN                   | $6          | $182.50        |
| Azure Firewall Premium       | $42         | $1,277.50      |
| VM (Standard_B2s w/ Windows) | $1.19       | $36.21         |
